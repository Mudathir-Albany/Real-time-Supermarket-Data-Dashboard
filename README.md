# Real-time-Supermarket-Data-Dashboard
The "Real-time Supermarket Data Dashboard" is a web application that provides real-time insights into supermarket sales data. The dashboard connects to a specific Google Drive folder where the latest sales data files are dropped. With a simple click of a refresh button, the dashboard automatically retrieves and analyzes the most recent sales data, allowing users to visualize key metrics, trends, and patterns. This project offers an efficient and user-friendly way to monitor and explore supermarket sales performance, enabling data-driven decision-making for stakeholders in the retail industry.
